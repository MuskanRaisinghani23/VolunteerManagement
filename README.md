# WEVolunteer Project 

## Project Overview
WEVolunteer is a Java-based application developed in NetBeans with the aim of creating a centralized system to connect volunteers with organizations . The project focuses on streamlining the process of mapping volunteering opportunities to aid requests, fostering a sense of community engagement and support.

## Problem Statement
Currently, there is no centralized system to efficiently connect volunteers with those seeking help. WEVolunteer aims to bridge this gap by providing a platform for companies, NGOs, and aid requesters to collaborate and coordinate effectively.

## Project Purpose
The primary purpose of WEVolunteer is to:
- Facilitate the efficient mapping of volunteers to aid requests.
- Enable companies, individuals, and NGOs to sign up for volunteering tasks.
- Provide a platform for aid requesters to raise requests and receive support.
- Enhance disaster management by coordinating aid and volunteer efforts during natural disasters.
- Encourage community engagement and volunteerism on a larger scale.
- Encourage global community engagement and volunteerism, fostering prosperity, love, and a sense of shared humanity.

A module with test cases demonstrating solution correctness, in order the populate data we have used the faker module and python scripts.

## Future Enhancements
WEVolunteer plans to conduct further research to identify and map homeless individuals to volunteers or NGOs. The model will be extended based on the findings from this research.
